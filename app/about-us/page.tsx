                            CassPea (which incidentally has nothing to do with peas) is a combination of my daughters' names. The project really
                            started about 7 years ago when as newly weds, my wife and I opened a small chocolate shop in Mexico city.

                            With little experience and a lot of passion we worked endlessly to establish a quality brand in Mexico. After 5 years
                            we decided to relocate back to the UK and start our lives with our little ones.
